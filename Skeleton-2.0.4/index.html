        <h4>My Favorite Sports Team</h4>
        <p>The St. Louis Cardinals are a professional baseball team based in St. Louis, Missouri, that competes in the National League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). The new Busch Stadium has been their home stadium since 2006. With origins as one of the early professional baseball clubs in St. Louis, entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased a barnstorming club in 1881 then known as the Brown Stockings and established them as charter members of the American Association (AA) the following season. Upon the discontinuation of the AA, St. Louis joined the NL in 1892; at that time, they were called the Browns and the Perfectos before they were officially renamed as the Cardinals in 1900.</p>
